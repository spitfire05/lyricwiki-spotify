lyricwiki-spotify
=================

Spotify app displaying LyricWiki page for currently playing track.

## Curent Status

Somewhat WIP.

## Installation

Download snapshot of this repo and put the *lyricwiki* folder into Spotify's local app folder.

For Windows:
```
My Documents/Spotify/
```

For Linux:
```
~/Spotify/
```

So the paths look for example like this:
```
My Documents/Spotify/lyricwiki/index.html
```

..and so on.

Launch spotify, and put following into search bar:
```
spotify:app:lyricwiki
```

And press enter. App will now load.
